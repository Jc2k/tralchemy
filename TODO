 * ?uri seems to be bad: If its an internal thing then it should error or be hidden completely, but instead i get results but they are empty strings
 * Notify: If a class is marked with tracker:notify then we should attach appropriate helps for listening
   for changes
 * Label: What the heck is the intention of the label property. A few ontologies use camel case, making it
   appropriate as a name for classes and properties. However a few have spaces, making it not :( :(
 * Modules: Would probably make sense to have a virtual module per namespace
